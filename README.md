About the Dataset
This dataset contains 212,691 records with 23 attributes, simulating real-world risk factors for thyroid cancer. The dataset is intentionally designed to reflect scenarios that include:

Intentional bias toward certain ethnicities, countries, and risk factors.

Risk factors such as radiation exposure, iodine deficiency, and family history.

Potential Use Cases
The dataset can be used for:

Machine learning modeling (classification, regression, etc.).

Bias detection and fairness analysis.

Medical research simulations.

Studies on health disparities related to ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic factors.

Dataset Structure
Number of records: 212,691

Number of attributes: 23

Examples of attributes:

Age, gender, ethnicity, country of origin.

History of radiation exposure.

Iodine levels.

Family history of thyroid cancer.

Important Note
This dataset is simulated and does not represent real patient data. It is designed for academic and research purposes, with a focus on bias and fairness analysis in machine learning models.
